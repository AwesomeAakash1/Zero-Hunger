# Zero-Hunger (3rd Place at 2022 HackFTW Hackathon)
## Inspiration
We were inspired by the enormous magnitude of the Zero Hunger Goal and how it won't be solved by 2030.

## What it does
Our app provides useful information and resources to further the global goal of Zero Hunger.

## How we built it
We built it using Android Studios.

## Challenges we ran into
We were fully new to the platform and we didn't know how to code in it. So we learned by watching tutorials and viewing official documentation.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made a fully functioning Android app that earned 3rd place at the hackathon. We learned how to program applications.

## What we learned
We learned how to create an Android application in Java using classes, XML, and designing.

## What's next for Zero Hunger
We don't have any further plans for this application as of yet. However, we hope to implement an in-app solution to donate to organizations. We also aim to make a Swift / iOS implementation of the Zero Hunger app.
